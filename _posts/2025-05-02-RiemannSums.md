1. What Are Riemann Sums?
Riemann sums are a way to approximate the area under a curve.

They form the basis of definite integrals in calculus.

The idea is to divide the interval into small subintervals and add the area of rectangles that estimate the area under the curve.

2. Basic Setup
To approximate the area under f(x) on interval [a,b]:
Divide [a,b] into n equal parts
Width of each subinterval is:
Δx = (b - a) / n
For each rectangle, pick a sample point x_i, and compute
Area ≈ Σ f(x_i) · Δx

3. Types of Riemann Sums
a. Left Riemann Sum (Il)
Uses the left endpoint of each subinterval:
Il = Σ f(x_i) · Δx  from i = 0 to n-1

b. Right Riemann Sum (Ir)
Uses the right endpoint:
Ir = Σ f(x_i) · Δx  from i = 1 to n
Left sums often underestimate.

Right sums often overestimate. 
As n→∞, both converge to the same value — the definite integral.

4. Definite Integral Definition
The definite integral from a to b of f(x) is:
∫ from a to b f(x) dx = lim (n→∞) Σ f(x_i) · Δx
This is the exact area under the curve when the number of rectangles approaches infinity.

5. Example Approximation
Estimate the area under f(x)=√(1−x^2) from 0 to 1 using 4 subintervals:

Left sum (Il) ≈ 0.8739

Right sum (Ir) ≈ 0.6239

Actual area = π/4 ≈ 0.7854

More subintervals → better estimate:

With 8 subintervals:

Il ≈ 0.8350

Ir ≈ 0.7100

6. Negative Area
If f(x)<0 over some intervals, the Riemann sum gives a negative value.
This represents area below the x-axis.
Example:
∫ from 0 to 2π sin(x) dx = 0
Because the area above and below the x-axis cancel out.
