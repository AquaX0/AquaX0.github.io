So this is a project of mine that i made for a task where we were asked to create a game in python. So i made a blackjack game (because i love blackjack) which has 77 lines of codes. It's not that impressive, but for me it is pretty impressive. Anyway, the game isn't that advanced, you can only do hit and stands and hope the bot doesn't get a higher number than yours that doesn't exceed 21 or hits a blackjack.
