1. What is a Limit?
A limit describes the value that a function approaches as the input approaches a specific point. Limits are foundational in defining derivatives and continuity in calculus.

2. Tangent Line Problem
The tangent to a curve at a point is the line that just "touches" the curve at that point and has the same slope as the curve.

To find the tangent line, we approximate its slope using secant lines between two points on the curve.

As the second point approaches the first, the secant slope approaches the limit — the slope of the tangent line.

3. The Velocity Problem
Instantaneous velocity is the limit of average velocity over a shrinking time interval.

For example, if s(t) = 4.9 * t^2 (position of a falling object), then the velocity at time t is found by taking the limit of [s(t + h) - s(t)] / h as h → 0.

4. Formal Definition of a Limit
We say that the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L if the values of f(x) can be made arbitrarily close to L by taking x sufficiently close to a (but not equal to a).

Written as:
lim x→a f(x) = L

5. One-Sided Limits
Left-hand limit: lim x→a⁻ f(x)

Right-hand limit: lim x→a⁺ f(x)

The regular (two-sided) limit exists only if both one-sided limits exist and are equal.

6. When Limits Do Not Exist
If the function oscillates (e.g., sin(1/x) near x = 0).

If there’s a jump (e.g., step functions like the Heaviside function).

If the function approaches infinity (e.g., 1/x² as x → 0).

7. Limit Laws (if lim x→a f(x) and lim x→a g(x) exist)
Sum: lim x→a [f(x) + g(x)] = lim f(x) + lim g(x)

Difference: lim x→a [f(x) - g(x)] = lim f(x) - lim g(x)

Product: lim x→a [f(x) * g(x)] = lim f(x) * lim g(x)

Quotient: lim x→a [f(x) / g(x)] = lim f(x) / lim g(x), provided lim g(x) ≠ 0

8. Techniques to Evaluate Limits
Direct substitution (if the function is continuous)

Algebraic simplification (e.g., factoring, canceling, rationalizing)

Use of tables or graphs to estimate behavior near the point

9. Special Limits
lim x→0 (sin x) / x = 1

lim x→0 [sqrt(x^2 + 9) - 3] / x^2 = 1/6

For piecewise functions, check both one-sided limits to determine the overall limit
